- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @randolphgamo
- I am constantly learning. I try to solve human problems using software.
- Here's my creed: 
- ðŸŒ± Successful people start before they feel ready| Permit yourself to write junk | Produce the 1st draft as quickly as possible. You can always optimize after | Don't be afraid to make mistakes | Frontend is about trial and error.
